<p>wouldn't you, couldn't you spare me a dime<br />
the world is in peril I haven't got time<br />
to explain the evils against us<br />
are vast and unknown in darkness and scope<br />
but with a dollar from you and<br />
perhaps a bit more we can take them<br />
to church oh praise the almighty! yes!<br />
I do take checks so write me<br />
one now for your home and your farm and<br />
your children as well won't you think of<br />
them now how we must save the world<br />
I can't do it alone I need you by my side<br />
with your wallet wide open but do shut your eyes<br />
for the mess I am cleaning is ugly and large<br />
just trust me and pay me and put me in charge<br />
you know i'm not scheming against you! oh no!<br />
that's what they'll tell you! they're liars you know!<br />
more money please now or they'll sell you on taxes<br />
but give me your change and<br />
I'll stop them with quibbles so strange and arcane<br />
we cannot relax yet<br />
I know you are hurting<br />
but this is important<br />
we must stay strong to be one day rewarded<br />
by God or at least by Saint Nick<br />
now give me more money! step to it! be quick!</p>
