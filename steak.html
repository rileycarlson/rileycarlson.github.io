                <h3>Steak</h3>

<p>Steak has always intimidated me. It occupies a place of such prestige in the pantheon of American cuisine. You must know the language of steak or be labeled a bumpkin. If you dare to order anything more charred than medium-rare then there are those who will judge you to damnation.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there is a tomato variety named Beefsteak. Surprisingly, there is no cattle DNA spliced into this cultivar (that I am aware of). I also doubt that it tastes immensely of steak.</p>

<p>We should not discriminate our steaks too stringently. There are also mushroom steaks. And there exist cauliflower steaks. But below the surface we all know they are attempting to ride on the coattails of cow steaks. They ought to try to be their own thing rather than trying to be someone they are not. Perhaps they would feel better about themselves if they did not lie so.</p>

<p>You cannot have a chicken steak or a pig steak. Perhaps you could have a buffalo steak? Or is the correct term bison steak? Yak steak? Ox steak? Elephant steak? There is so much we do not know about the world.</p>

<p>Blue steak is the rarest of rare. It is called blue because we just strangled the cow out back and took the cleaver to its flank. We wrung most of the blood out, but you may notice a dribble or two. It is still warm. If you put your ear to it you can hear the fading heartbeat of the cow. Served alongside raw milk.</p>

<p>Milk steak is not really a thing.</p>

<p>There are many types of steaks. There exists porterhouse and tenderloin and ribeye and strip and New York strip (or maybe all the strips are from New York. I am not a New Yorker so I do not know) and others that have names (although the names do not exist in my mind at this moment). You cannot simply ask for a steak. Or, you could, but they would likely ask you to clarify about which steak in particular you are after. I suppose that if there was a steak special then you could ask for 'the steak'. But that is a special situation.</p>

<p>That is about all I have to say about steak. It is not something I cook or eat often. There exist too many opinions on how steak ought to be, and it is too much pressure to fulfill those hopes and dreams. Steak is quite tasty (even if it falls short of all those hopes and dreams). There are also questions of the ethics of slaughtering cows for their flesh, but those are not questions I ask often. I thank them for their sacrifice. I hope they lived well and had happy moments. All things that live must die.</p>

<p>Bon appetit.</p>
